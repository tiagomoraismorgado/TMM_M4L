<sub>Collection of maxforlive devices by TEM44. By now, the library consists mostly of midi data processors and generators, and aims basically at generating and treating MIDI data. there are a couple of exceptions like audio delays and audio structure generators made with beap, but the main focus relies basically on MIDI data. nJoy!!!</sub> <sub>, if you like to use these devices.</sub>
